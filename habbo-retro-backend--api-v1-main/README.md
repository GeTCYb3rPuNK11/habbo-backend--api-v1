this API connects from your habbo retro client with the VPS or dedicated server, you must put the javascript file inside the folder where you have your server files. works with Xampp/ IIS After doing that, restart the emulator and you will notice the difference remember that this is version v1 soon there will be improvements (:

Steps to make the api work correctly:

1. Configure by putting the urls of your server in the api, it has to be the same, there can be no failures or it will not work.

2. Add the javascript file to your Xampp / IIS webserver in its corresponding folder.

3. configure the corresponding ports with your emulator in the api.

4. turn on the emulator (everything must be correctly configured)
